## [Cooking project] (/cooking_project_2023/)
Mini cooking game prototype. Visitors come, make orders of fast food and a player is supposed to serve them in time. Player taps on one of 4 food sources on the table to send a dish to the first visitor in the queue with a fitting order.
When a visitor gets the full list of food he wanted, he happily walks away. If his timer runs out, then he walks out unsatisfied.
In the end you get results represented in stars reflecting your success.
